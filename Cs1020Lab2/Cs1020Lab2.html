<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Kiwi is my pet Shiba Inu. I got her when she was 4 months old from Petland in Iowa City. I knew what kind of dog I wanted and she was perfect for me. Though very independent, energetic, and aloof, at night when she thinks I'm asleep, she'll nuzzle her way next to me and start snoring soundly.</p>
